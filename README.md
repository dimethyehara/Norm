The bot is based on the original work done by [PaulSonOfLars](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars)
This repo was just revamped to suit an Anime-centric community and it was revamped as Ai Admin. All original credits go to Paul and his dedication, Without his efforts, this fork would not have been possible!
